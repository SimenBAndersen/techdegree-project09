# techdegree-project09
Gallery App using React

This is the 9th of in total 12 projects I will complete through Treehouse's Fullstack Javascript techdegree. 

Technology used:
- React and React-Router
- Axios

In this project:
- Fetches photos from Flickr
- User can type in a search-text or choose from predefined searches

Important:
- To run this program you'll need to include a config.js file in the root directory. The file should export an object containing a key("key") with the value of a Flickr API key.
